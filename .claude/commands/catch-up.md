description: Review recent journals and commits and summarize current state
---

Review recent journal files in journal/ directory, as well as recent git history:
1. Read the most recent journal file completely
2. List the 5-10 previous journal titles (by date, descending)
3. Based on the latest journal's "Next Steps" and topic, identify which older journals seem relevant
4. Read only those relevant journals (typically 1-3 more)
5. Take a look at the latest commit messages

Provide a concise summary of:
1. What was worked on most recently
2. Key decisions that affect current work
3. Open questions/blockers
4. Recommended next steps

Prioritize continuity over completeness - focus on what's needed to resume work.
