# 2025-10-10: Search API and Testing Documentation Complete

**Date**: 2025-10-10
**Status**: ✅ Complete

## Overview

Completed two major documentation tasks:
1. **Search API Documentation** - Comprehensive guide with examples, limitations, and best practices
2. **Testing Guide** - Focused documentation on test organization, patterns, and the master switch

Additionally standardized all integration test tags across the codebase for consistency.

## Work Completed

### 1. Documentation: `docs/search.md`

**Status**: ✅ Complete (WIP notice removed)

Created comprehensive documentation covering:

#### Core Sections
- **Overview**: Clear explanation of what Search API does and when to use it
- **Available Operations**: Both DSL and string query methods
- **Quick Start**: Immediate working examples
- **Examples**: 7 detailed example sections covering all use cases

#### Example Categories
1. **Basic Search**: Empty search and query search
2. **Filter by Object Type**: Pages vs data sources (2025-09-03 API)
3. **Sort Results**: Ascending and descending by last_edited_time
4. **Pagination**: Basic pagination loop with cursor handling
5. **Combining Features**: Filters + sorting + pagination together
6. **Search All Accessible Content**: Complete pagination pattern
7. **Common Patterns**: Validation, access checks, timeframe searches

#### Reference Sections
- **DSL Reference**: Complete API surface with all methods
- **Response Structure**: SearchResponse model documentation
- **Important Limitations**: 4 key limitations explained
  - Search indexing delay
  - Title search only (not content)
  - Not for database queries
  - Not for exhaustive enumeration
  - API version differences (data_source vs database)

#### Gotchas Section
- Empty query returns everything
- Results as JsonElement (polymorphic handling)
- Page size validation (1-100)
- Pagination cursor usage

#### Best Practices
- **✅ DO**: 6 recommended practices
- **❌ DON'T**: 5 anti-patterns to avoid

#### Testing Section
- Explains why no SearchExamples.kt file exists
- Links to existing unit and integration tests
- Provides mock testing example
- Transparency about workspace-dependent nature of search

### 2. Design Decision: No SearchExamples.kt

**Rationale**: Search API is different from other APIs because:
- Can only search content already shared with the integration
- We can't predict or create known test data
- Search results are workspace-dependent
- Existing integration tests validate API functionality
- Documentation examples are sufficient and self-explanatory

**Documentation Transparency**: Added explicit note in Testing section explaining:
```
Unlike other APIs (Pages, Blocks, etc.), the Search API doesn't have a
dedicated examples file (SearchExamples.kt). This is because:
- Search only finds content already shared with your integration
- We can't predict what content exists in a user's workspace
- The examples in this documentation are ready to use - just adapt the
  search queries to match your own content
```

### 3. API Coverage Validation

Reviewed implementation to ensure documentation matches:
- ✅ `search(request: SearchRequest)` - Main DSL method
- ✅ `search(query: String)` - Convenience method
- ✅ `searchRequest {}` - DSL builder with all options
  - `query()` - Text search
  - `filterPages()` / `filterDataSources()` - Object type filters
  - `sortAscending()` / `sortDescending()` - Sort options
  - `pageSize()` - Pagination size (1-100)
  - `startCursor()` - Pagination cursor

All documented features match actual implementation.

## Key Documentation Highlights

### Clarity on 2025-09-03 API Changes
Emphasized throughout that the new API uses `"data_source"` not `"database"`:
```kotlin
// ✅ 2025-09-03 API
filterDataSources()

// ❌ Old API (won't work)
filter.value = "database"
```

### Practical Pagination Pattern
Provided complete, copy-paste-ready pagination loop:
```kotlin
var cursor: String? = null
do {
    val page = notion.search.search(searchRequest {
        query("documentation")
        startCursor(cursor)
        pageSize(50)
    })
    // Process page.results
    cursor = page.nextCursor
} while (page.hasMore)
```

### JsonElement Handling Guidance
Explained why results are `List<JsonElement>` and how to handle:
```kotlin
results.results.forEach { element ->
    val objectType = element.jsonObject["object"]?.jsonPrimitive?.content
    when (objectType) {
        "page" -> { /* Deserialize as Page */ }
        "database" -> { /* Deserialize as DataSource */ }
    }
}
```

### Search Limitations Clearly Stated
Made it explicit what Search API **cannot** do:
- Cannot search page content (titles only)
- Cannot query within a specific database (use Query API)
- Not immediate (indexing delay)
- Not for systematic enumeration

## Testing Results

### Unit Tests
```bash
./gradlew test -Dkotest.tags.include="Unit"
```
**Result**: ✅ All 481 tests passing (~13s)

### Existing Test Coverage
- **Unit Tests** (`SearchApiTest.kt`): 5 tests with mock responses
  - Search with query
  - Search with filters
  - Search with sort and pagination
  - Search with data source filter
  - Empty search

- **Integration Tests** (`SearchIntegrationTest.kt`): 4 scenarios
  - Basic search returns accessible content
  - Search with query filters results
  - Search DSL with filters works
  - Data source search with 2025-09-03 API

## Documentation Quality Standards Met

### ✅ Comprehensive Examples
Every major feature has working code examples that users can copy-paste and adapt.

### ✅ Clear Limitations
Important limitations and gotchas are prominently documented to prevent misuse.

### ✅ API Version Awareness
2025-09-03 API changes are highlighted throughout (data_source vs database).

### ✅ Best Practices Guidance
Clear DO/DON'T sections help users avoid common mistakes.

### ✅ Testing Transparency
Honest explanation of why SearchExamples.kt doesn't exist, with guidance on testing.

### ✅ Related APIs
Links to Pages, Data Sources, and Query Database documentation for related functionality.

## Files Modified

- `docs/search.md` - Complete rewrite with comprehensive documentation (~375 lines)

## No Files Created

**Deliberate Decision**: Did not create `src/test/kotlin/examples/SearchExamples.kt`
- Documented rationale in Testing section
- Existing integration tests are sufficient
- Documentation examples are ready-to-use

## Comparison with Other Documentation

This documentation follows the same high-quality pattern as:
- `docs/users.md` (2025-10-09) - Complete with examples, patterns, best practices
- `docs/error-handling.md` (2025-10-08) - Comprehensive with gotchas and testing
- `docs/rich-text-dsl.md` (2025-10-09) - Detailed with all features documented

Search API documentation is now at the same quality level as these other completed docs.

## Remaining Documentation Work

Based on `grep -r "TODO\|WIP" docs/*.md`, only one file remains incomplete:

### `docs/testing.md`
Still has multiple TODOs:
- Add mocking examples showing how to test code that uses NotionClient
- Add guidance on managing test data in Notion workspace
- Add tips, gotchas, best practices
- Add pagination testing examples
- Add error scenario testing examples

This is the **last remaining documentation task** from the original incomplete docs list.

## Next Steps

### Recommended for Next Session
Complete `docs/testing.md` following the same pattern:
1. Review existing test infrastructure (we have excellent patterns)
2. Document MockEngine usage for unit testing
3. Document integration test patterns (we use this extensively)
4. Add examples of testing pagination
5. Add examples of testing error scenarios
6. Document test data management strategies
7. Remove WIP notice

**Estimated Complexity**: Medium - We have great test infrastructure to document, but testing guidance requires careful thought about patterns and best practices.

## Lessons Learned

### When Not to Create Example Files
Search API taught us that not every API needs an examples file:
- If examples are workspace-dependent, documentation examples are better
- If existing integration tests validate functionality, that's sufficient
- Transparency about decisions builds trust

### Documentation Completeness
A well-documented API should have:
1. Clear overview of what it does and doesn't do
2. Working examples for every major feature
3. Explicit limitations and gotchas
4. Best practices and anti-patterns
5. Testing guidance appropriate to the API
6. Links to related functionality

### API Version Changes
When documenting APIs with version changes:
- Use ✅/❌ markers to show correct vs incorrect usage
- Mention the API version explicitly
- Provide both old and new approaches for clarity
- Repeat the guidance where users might need it

## Commands Run

```bash
./gradlew formatKotlin  # ✅ No issues
./gradlew test -Dkotest.tags.include="Unit"  # ✅ 481 tests passing
```

## Notes

- No code changes were needed - only documentation
- All existing tests continue to pass
- Documentation is ready for users to copy-paste and adapt
- Search API is now fully documented and production-ready

### 4. Integration Test Tags Standardization

Standardized tags across all 26 integration tests:

**Files Updated:**
- **21 files** added `@Tags("Integration", "RequiresApi")`
- **4 files** changed from `@Tags("Slow")` to `@Tags("Integration", "RequiresApi", "Slow")`
- **10 files** needed `import io.kotest.core.annotation.Tags` added

**Tag Patterns:**
- Standard integration tests: `@Tags("Integration", "RequiresApi")`
- Slow integration tests: `@Tags("Integration", "RequiresApi", "Slow")`
- Unit tests: `@Tags("Unit")` (already consistent)
- Example tests: `@Tags("Integration", "RequiresApi", "Examples")` (already consistent)

**Verification:**
- All 26 integration test files now consistently tagged
- All tests compile and pass
- Used Unix commands to efficiently identify and update files

### 5. Documentation: `docs/testing.md`

**Status**: ✅ Complete (WIP notice removed)

Created focused, digestible testing guide covering:

#### Core Sections
- **Test Organization**: Unit, integration, and example test locations and purposes
- **The Master Switch**: `NOTION_RUN_INTEGRATION_TESTS` env var as safety mechanism
- **Running Tests**: Fast development workflow, specific integration tests, and warnings
- **Environment Variables**: Table of all required variables with purposes
- **Test Infrastructure**: TestFixtures and MockResponseBuilder patterns
- **Testing Your Own Code**: Both mock and real API examples
- **Important Warnings**: Don't run all tests, don't test production, don't commit secrets
- **Tag System**: Reference table for Kotest tags

#### Key Features
- **Focused and digestible**: Kept it simple, not overwhelming
- **Highlighted master switch**: Emphasized `NOTION_RUN_INTEGRATION_TESTS` as primary safety
- **Realistic examples**: Only documented actual capabilities in MockResponseBuilder
- **Clear warnings**: Prominent warnings about running all integration tests
- **Tag reference**: Complete table of tag meanings and usage

#### What We Avoided
- Overly comprehensive examples that would overwhelm readers
- Hallucinating capabilities that don't exist
- Complex patterns that aren't actually used in the codebase
- Unnecessary detail that obscures the main points
