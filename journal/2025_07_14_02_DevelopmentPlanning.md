# 2025-07-14 - Development Planning Session

## Current State Assessment
The Kotlin Notion client is approximately **75% feature complete** for core functionality:

**✅ Fully Implemented:**
- Complete CRUD operations for Pages, Databases, Blocks (append), Comments
- Comprehensive property type support (all Notion property types)
- Advanced features: rate limiting, automatic pagination, validation with auto-fixing
- Production-ready file upload with chunking and retry logic
- Robust testing infrastructure with official sample responses

**❌ Intentionally Excluded:**
- Search API (outside current use case scope)

**⚠️ Core Gaps Identified:**
- Block update/delete operations (can only append children)
- Database schema updates (cannot modify properties)
- Some block types: tables, embeds, bookmarks

## Next Development Phase Plan

### Phase 1: DSL Development (Priority)
**Goal**: Improve developer experience with fluent, Kotlin-idiomatic APIs

1. **Content Creation DSL**
   - Fluent builders for pages and blocks
   - Type-safe property builders 
   - Convenience methods for common patterns (image/video/file uploads)

2. **Query DSL** 
   - Simplified database filtering/sorting syntax
   - Type-safe query composition
   - Natural language-like query building

3. **Configuration DSL**
   - Enhanced NotionConfig with fluent configuration
   - Environment-based configuration patterns

### Phase 2: Missing Core Features
1. Block update/delete operations
2. Database schema modification API
3. Complete remaining block types (tables, embeds, bookmarks)

### Phase 3: Polish & Production Readiness
1. Code coverage analysis and gap filling
2. Comprehensive documentation with DSL examples
3. File structure optimization
4. Performance analysis and optimization
5. Enhanced error messages and debugging support

## Implementation Strategy
- Build DSLs on top of existing solid foundation
- Maintain backward compatibility with current APIs
- Follow established patterns from validation system
- Use builder pattern with Kotlin DSL features
- Comprehensive testing for all new abstractions

## Success Criteria
- Reduced boilerplate for common operations
- Type-safe, discoverable APIs
- Clear separation between low-level and high-level APIs
- Excellent developer experience with IntelliJ autocompletion
