## Accomplishments

- **File Upload API**: Implemented comprehensive file upload functionality with support for both direct uploads and external URL imports
- **Media Support**: Expanded support for various media types across the API
- **Comments API**: Built complete Comments API with user mentions and rich text support
- **Bug Fix**: Resolved file upload serialization issues that were blocking integration tests

## Technical Decisions

- Designed file upload to handle both multipart uploads and external URL references
- Implemented waitForFileReady mechanism to handle Notion's asynchronous file processing
- Added support for user mentions in comments using proper user object references

## Challenges

- File upload serialization required careful handling of multipart/form-data
- Notion's async file processing needed polling mechanism with timeout handling
- User mentions in comments required special rich text annotation format

## API Insights

- Files uploaded to Notion are processed asynchronously and may not be immediately available
- External file URLs must be properly encoded and validated
- Comment mentions use a specific annotation format distinct from other rich text

## Files Modified

- Added new file upload functionality to core API
- Enhanced Comments API implementation
- Fixed serialization in media-related models
- Code formatting improvements in file handling methods

## Next Steps

- Add retry logic for file processing timeouts
- Implement batch file upload capabilities
- Consider adding file type validation before upload
