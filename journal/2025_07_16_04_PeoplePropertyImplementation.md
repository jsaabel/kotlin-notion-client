# 2025-07-16 04: People Property Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented the missing `people()` method in the DatabaseRequestBuilder DSL, addressing the issue identified in the previous diary entry.

## Problem Addressed
The DatabaseRequestBuilder DSL was missing support for the "people" property type, which is a standard Notion database property for user mentions and assignments.

## Implementation Details

### Changes Made
1. **Added People property to CreateDatabaseProperty** (`DatabaseRequests.kt`):
   - Added `CreateDatabaseProperty.People` class with proper serialization
   - Follows the same pattern as other simple properties (checkbox, email, etc.)
   - Uses `EmptyObject` for configuration, matching Notion API specification

2. **Implemented people() method in DatabasePropertiesBuilder** (`DatabaseRequestBuilder.kt`):
   - Added `people(name: String)` method to the DSL
   - Updated KDoc example to include people property usage
   - Maintains consistency with existing property methods

3. **Enhanced test coverage**:
   - Updated unit tests to include people property verification
   - Added people property to integration test for real API validation
   - All tests passing successfully

### Technical Details
- The `DatabaseProperty.People` response class already existed in `Database.kt`
- Implementation follows established patterns in the codebase
- Property uses empty configuration object as per Notion API documentation
- Properly serialized with `@SerialName("people")` annotation

### Code Quality
- All code formatted with `formatKotlin`
- Project builds successfully without errors
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Maintains type safety throughout the DSL

## Usage Example
```kotlin
val request = databaseRequest {
    parent.page(parentPageId)
    title("Project Database")
    properties {
        title("Task Name")
        people("Assignee")          // ‚Üê New people property
        checkbox("Completed")
    }
}
```

## Testing
- **Unit tests**: All passing, including new people property tests
- **Integration tests**: Updated to include people property with real API validation
- **Build verification**: Project compiles and lints successfully

## Next Steps
Based on this work, we should consider implementing a **DSL builder for rich text blocks/paragraphs**. This would provide a more intuitive way to construct complex rich text content for:
- Database descriptions
- Page content
- Block content
- Property values

The rich text DSL could support:
- Text formatting (bold, italic, code)
- Links and mentions
- Colors and annotations
- Nested text structures

This would complement the database property DSL and provide a more complete authoring experience for Notion content.
