# 2025-10-17: Maven Central Publication Preparation

**Date**: 2025-10-17
**Status**: üöß In Progress

## Overview

Final preparation and cleanup work before publishing kotlin-notion-client v0.1.0 to Maven Central. This session focuses on addressing critical pre-publication issues identified during readiness assessment, including missing files, URL placeholders, and project configuration cleanup.

**Goal**: Address all blocking issues preventing Maven Central publication and prepare the project for its first public release.

## Context

Following the Maven Central publishing setup (journal entry 2025-10-15), we've uploaded artifacts to the Maven Central Portal. However, before clicking the final "Publish" button, a comprehensive readiness assessment revealed several critical issues that need to be resolved.

**Current State**:
- ‚úÖ Build configuration complete (Vanniktech Maven Publish Plugin)
- ‚úÖ GPG signing configured and working
- ‚úÖ Artifacts uploaded to Maven Central Portal
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Several critical pre-publication issues identified

## Pre-Publication Issues Identified

### Critical (Blocking)
1. **GitHub repository URLs** - Placeholder `yourusername` in build.gradle.kts and CHANGELOG.md
2. **Missing LICENSE file** - POM declares MIT License but no LICENSE file in repository
3. **QUICKSTART.md outdated** - Still says "Not yet published to Maven Central"
4. **Application plugin** - Unnecessary `application` plugin in build.gradle.kts (this is a library)

### Important (Should Fix)
5. **Version management** - Version hardcoded in two places (DRY violation)
6. **Kotlin version mismatch** - CHANGELOG says "Kotlin 1.9+" but using 2.2.20

### Nice to Have (Post-Release)
7. **API documentation** - Dokka configured but not publishing KDoc
8. **CONTRIBUTING.md** - Contributing guidelines
9. **GitHub repository setup** - Issues, CI/CD, templates
10. **Security policy** - SECURITY.md
11. **Code of Conduct** - CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
12. **Badges** - Maven Central, build status, license badges

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Critical Fixes (Must Complete)
- [ ] Create journal entry (this file)
- [ ] Add LICENSE file (MIT)
- [ ] Update GitHub URLs in build.gradle.kts
- [ ] Update GitHub URLs in CHANGELOG.md
- [ ] Remove application plugin from build.gradle.kts
- [ ] Fix Kotlin version in CHANGELOG.md
- [ ] Update QUICKSTART.md to remove "not yet published" note

### Phase 2: Version Management (Should Complete)
- [ ] Centralize version in gradle.properties
- [ ] Update build.gradle.kts to read version from gradle.properties

### Phase 3: Documentation & Polish (Nice to Have)
- [ ] Add CONTRIBUTING.md
- [ ] Add SECURITY.md
- [ ] Add CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
- [ ] Update README.md with badges (prepare badge URLs, add after publish)

### Phase 4: Verification
- [ ] Run full test suite
- [ ] Run linting and formatting
- [ ] Build project
- [ ] Publish to mavenLocal and test in separate project
- [ ] Review all changes

## Work Log

### Session 1: Assessment & Planning
**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete
**Time**: ~15 minutes

**Completed**:
1. ‚úÖ Analyzed project state for Maven Central readiness
2. ‚úÖ Identified critical, important, and nice-to-have issues
3. ‚úÖ Created prioritized implementation plan
4. ‚úÖ Created journal entry with established format

**Key Findings**:
- Core code and tests are in excellent shape (481+ tests passing)
- Documentation is comprehensive (14+ markdown files, 6 Jupyter notebooks)
- API coverage is complete (all 8 Notion API categories implemented)
- Main issues are metadata/configuration related (quick fixes)
- No code changes required, only project files

**Decisions**:
- Focus on critical fixes first before publishing
- Version management improvement is worth doing now (prevents future confusion)
- Documentation polish (CONTRIBUTING.md, etc.) can be done post-release but nice to include

### Session 2: Critical Fixes & Verification
**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete
**Time**: ~30 minutes

**Completed**:
1. ‚úÖ LICENSE file already existed (MIT License with correct copyright)
2. ‚úÖ Updated GitHub URLs:
   - Fixed CHANGELOG.md release link (yourusername ‚Üí jsaabel)
   - Fixed README.md clone URL (yourusername ‚Üí jsaabel)
   - build.gradle.kts already had correct URLs
3. ‚úÖ Removed application plugin and Main.kt:
   - Removed `application` plugin from build.gradle.kts
   - Removed `application { mainClass }` configuration block
   - Deleted `src/main/kotlin/it/saabel/kotlinnotionclient/Main.kt`
   - Rationale: Libraries shouldn't have main entry points; cleaner architecture
4. ‚úÖ Fixed Kotlin version in CHANGELOG.md (1.9+ ‚Üí 2.2+)
5. ‚úÖ Updated QUICKSTART.md:
   - Removed "Not yet published to Maven Central" note
   - Changed to positive installation instructions
6. ‚úÖ Centralized version management:
   - Added `version=0.1.0` and `group=it.saabel` to gradle.properties
   - Updated build.gradle.kts to read from properties
   - Updated coordinates() call to use variables
   - Single source of truth for version/group
7. ‚úÖ Added CONTRIBUTING.md:
   - Development setup instructions
   - Code contribution workflow
   - Testing guidelines
   - Code style requirements
   - What we're looking for from contributors

**Verification**:
- ‚úÖ `./gradlew formatKotlin` - Successful
- ‚úÖ `./gradlew test -Dkotest.tags.include="Unit"` - All tests passing
- ‚úÖ `./gradlew build` - Clean build, no errors

**Files Changed**:
- CHANGELOG.md - Fixed GitHub URL and Kotlin version
- README.md - Fixed GitHub URL
- build.gradle.kts - Removed application plugin, centralized version
- gradle.properties - Added version and group
- QUICKSTART.md - Removed "not published" note
- CONTRIBUTING.md - Created new file (comprehensive contribution guide)
- src/main/kotlin/.../Main.kt - Deleted (library shouldn't have main)

**Build Output**:
- All unit tests passing
- Linting clean
- No warnings (except JDK deprecation warning unrelated to our code)
- Build artifacts generated successfully

---

## Notes & Observations

- The project is remarkably close to being publication-ready
- Most issues are metadata/configuration, not code quality issues
- The comprehensive documentation and test coverage are significant strengths
- Publishing to Maven Central requires attention to project hygiene details

## Success Criteria

**For This Session**:
- [ ] All critical issues resolved
- [ ] Version management centralized
- [ ] All tests passing
