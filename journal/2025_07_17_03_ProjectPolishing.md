        heading1 { text("Page Creation") }
        paragraph {
            text("This page was created using: ")
            code("notionClient.createPage { ... }")
        }

        // Document database operations by creating a database
        val database = createExampleDatabase()
        paragraph {
            text("Database created with ID: ")
            code(database.id)
        }

        // Document rich text by using rich text
        demonstrateRichTextCapabilities()

        // Document block operations by manipulating blocks
        demonstrateBlockOperations()
    }
}
```

## Update: Fat JAR & Jupyter Notebook Integration

### Shadow Plugin Implementation ✅

Successfully added the Shadow Gradle plugin to build fat JARs for notebook integration:

```kotlin
// build.gradle.kts
plugins {
    // ... existing plugins
    alias(libs.plugins.shadow)
}

tasks.shadowJar {
    archiveClassifier.set("")
    archiveFileName.set("kotlin-notion-client-${project.version}.jar")
    mergeServiceFiles()
}
```

### Jupyter Notebook Integration Challenges 🔄

**Challenge 1: LogLevel Import Issues**

- **Problem**: Jupyter couldn't access `io.ktor.client.plugins.logging.LogLevel` from fat JAR
- **Solution**: Added simplified constructor `NotionClient.create(apiToken: String)` to avoid LogLevel dependency
- **Implementation**:
  ```kotlin
  companion object {
      fun create(apiToken: String): NotionClient = create(NotionConfig(apiToken = apiToken))
  }
  ```

**Challenge 2: Variable Scoping Issues**

- **Problem**: `client` variable defined in try-catch block wasn't accessible to other notebook cells
- **Solution**: Moved client creation to global scope with proper error handling

**Challenge 3: Kotlin Serialization Version Compatibility 🚨**

- **Problem**: Critical serialization error when using newer dependency versions:
  ```
  JsonConvertException: Illegal input: 'kotlinx.serialization.KSerializer[] 
  kotlinx.serialization.internal.GeneratedSerializer.typeParametersSerializers()'
  ```
- **Root Cause**: Kotlin 2.2.0 + kotlinx-serialization 1.9.0 incompatible with Jupyter Kotlin kernel
- **Solution**: Downgraded to compatible versions:
  ```toml
  kotlin = "2.0.21"              # Was: "2.2.0"
  kotlinx-serialization-json = "1.7.3"  # Was: "1.9.0"
  ktor = "3.0.1"                 # Was: "3.2.1"
  ```

### Implications & Lessons Learned 📚
