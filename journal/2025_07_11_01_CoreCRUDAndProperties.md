# 2025-07-11 - Core CRUD Operations and Property System

## Accomplishments

- **CRUD Operations**: Implemented comprehensive Create, Read, Update, Delete operations for both databases and pages
- **Database Query System**: Built advanced query system with filtering, sorting, and aggregation support
- **Type-Safe Properties**: Created type-safe page property access system preventing runtime errors
- **DSL Builders**: Implemented PagePropertiesBuilder DSL for intuitive property creation
- **Content Creation DSL**: Added DSL for creating rich content with icon support
- **Test Infrastructure**: Modernized integration tests and added comprehensive unit test coverage

## Technical Decisions

- Chose sealed classes for property types to ensure exhaustive handling
- Implemented builder pattern with DSL for complex object creation
- Optimized test performance by reusing Json instances in TestFixtures
- Used inline functions for type-safe property getters to maintain performance

## Challenges

- Designing type-safe API that handles Notion's dynamic property system
- Balancing ease of use with type safety in property access
- Managing the complexity of Notion's nested data structures

## Patterns Discovered

- Kotlin's sealed classes work excellently for Notion's discriminated unions
- DSL builders provide intuitive API while maintaining type safety
- Extension functions on sealed classes enable elegant property access

## Files Modified

- Major refactoring of Page and Database models
- New property access system implementation
- Comprehensive test suite additions
- Documentation cleanup (removed obsolete .txt file)

## Next Steps

- Implement property validation for write operations
- Add support for formula and rollup properties
- Consider adding property change tracking for efficient updates
