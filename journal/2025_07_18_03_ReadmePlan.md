# README.md Planning

## Overview

Plan for creating a comprehensive, informative, and engaging README.md for the Kotlin Notion Client project.

## Target Audience

- Kotlin developers looking for a Notion API client
- Teams wanting to integrate Notion into their Kotlin/JVM applications
- Contributors interested in the project
- Developers comparing different Notion client libraries

## README Structure Plan

### 1. Project Header

- **Title**: Kotlin Notion Client
- **Tagline**: A type-safe, coroutine-based Kotlin client for the Notion API
- **Badges**:
    - Kotlin version
    - API coverage status
    - License
    - Maven Central (when published)

### 2. Hero Section

- Brief description (2-3 sentences)
- Key selling points (bullets):
    - üöÄ Fully coroutine-based for non-blocking operations
    - üõ°Ô∏è Type-safe DSL for building pages, databases, and queries
    - üìù Rich text DSL with intuitive syntax

- Link to Notion API reference
- Link to project wiki (if created)

### 11. Comparison

Brief comparison table with other clients:

- Features
- Language idioms
- Performance characteristics
- Maintenance status

### 12. License & Credits

- MIT License
- Acknowledgments
- Notion trademark notice

## Content Guidelines

### Writing Style

- **Tone**: Professional but approachable
- **Examples**: Practical and real-world focused
- **Code blocks**: Well-commented and formatted
- **Emojis**: Used sparingly for visual scanning

### Code Examples

- Use realistic data (not "foo", "bar")
- Show both simple and advanced usage
- Include error handling where relevant
- Demonstrate the DSL advantages

### Visual Elements

- Code syntax highlighting
- Tables for comparisons
- Checkmark lists for features
- Clear section headers

## Implementation Notes

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with core sections, expand later
2. **Test Examples**: All code examples should be tested
3. **Update Regularly**: Keep in sync with API changes
4. **Community Input**: Leave room for feedback and contributions
5. **SEO**: Include relevant keywords for discoverability

## Publishing Considerations

### Maven Central

- Research requirements for publishing to Maven Central
- Set up necessary accounts and signing keys
- Configure Gradle for publishing
- Choose appropriate group ID (e.g., `io.github.username`)
- Prepare POM metadata

### Open Development Acknowledgment

- Be transparent about AI-assisted development
- Position as a real-world example of agentic coding
- Highlight collaboration between human and AI
- Potential section: "Built with Claude"
- Link to blog post or article about the development process

## Implementation Status

### Completed ‚úÖ

- Created comprehensive README-DRAFT.md with all planned sections
- Added clear draft warning about code examples needing verification
- Included "Built with Claude" section highlighting AI collaboration
- Added Maven Central publishing considerations

### Next Steps

1. Verify all code examples against actual implementation
2. Update API coverage table with accurate status
3. Create comparison table with other clients
4. Add badges and visual elements
5. Research Maven Central publishing requirements
6. Review and refine based on feedback
7. Rename to README.md when ready for production
