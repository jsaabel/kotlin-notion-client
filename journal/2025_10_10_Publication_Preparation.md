# 2025-10-10: Publication Preparation & Final Polish

**Date**: 2025-10-10
**Status**: 🚧 Planning

## Overview

The Kotlin Notion Client is feature-complete with comprehensive test coverage and documentation. This phase focuses on preparing the library for public release and addressing remaining polish items. **Priority: Work efficiently - publish soon.**

## Current State

**Strengths**:
- ✅ All major APIs implemented (Pages, Blocks, Databases, Data Sources, Search, Users, Comments)
- ✅ Complete pagination helpers with Flow support
- ✅ 481+ unit tests passing
- ✅ Comprehensive integration test coverage
- ✅ Complete documentation (all APIs, features, testing guide)
- ✅ Migrated to Notion API 2025-09-03
- ✅ Type-safe DSLs for queries, rich text, and blocks
- ✅ Date/time support using kotlinx-datetime (not latest version but functional)

**Known TODOs in Codebase**:
1. `RequestValidator.kt:528` - Replace println with proper logging
2. `NotionClient.kt:97` - Add documentation on HTTP client options
3. `PageProperty.kt:348` - Review temporary timezone normalization fix
4. `Database.kt:51` - Verify if URL should be nullable

## AI-Assisted Development Notice

**Important Context**: This project was developed heavily with Claude Code assistance. While substantial effort has been invested in verification through:
- Comprehensive unit testing (481+ tests)
- Real API integration tests
- Manual code review and oversight
- Testing against official Notion API samples

**Potential issues to be aware of**:
- Documentation may claim more than is actually implemented
- Syntax examples in docs might not match actual implementation
- Edge cases in API coverage may be missed
- Serialization/deserialization edge cases
- Type safety gaps in DSL builders
- Inconsistencies between similar APIs (e.g., different parameter names/patterns)
- Comments or documentation referring to non-existent functionality

**The README must acknowledge these risks transparently** and encourage users to report issues.

## Goals

### Primary Goal: Publish Efficiently
- Enable other developers to discover, install, and use the library
- Be transparent about AI assistance and potential gaps
- Provide clear channels for feedback

### Secondary Goal: Critical Polish Only
- Address only blocking issues
- Defer nice-to-haves to post-launch

## Task Categories & Prioritization

### Priority 1: BLOCKING - Must Complete Before Release

#### 1.1 Package Naming Convention ⚡ CRITICAL
**Current**: `no.saabelit.kotlinnotionclient`
**Target**: `it.saabel.kotlinnotionclient`

**Rationale**: Standard convention is reverse domain. Must be done before publication (breaking change).

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Refactor all package declarations
- [ ] Update imports across codebase
- [ ] Update build.gradle.kts with new group ID
- [ ] Update documentation references
- [ ] Verify tests still pass

**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 hours (mostly automated refactoring + verification)

#### 1.2 README Enhancement ⚡ CRITICAL

**Must Include**:
- [ ] **AI Development Transparency Section**
  - Acknowledge Claude Code assistance
  - List potential pitfalls (see "AI-Assisted Development Notice" above)
  - Encourage bug reports and contributions
  - Link to issue tracker
- [ ] **Installation instructions** (Gradle/Maven with JitPack initially)
- [ ] **Quick start example** (complete, runnable code)
- [ ] **Feature highlights** (key selling points)
- [ ] **Link to comprehensive docs**
- [ ] **License information**
- [ ] **Contributing guidelines** (emphasize verification of AI-generated code)

**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 hours

#### 1.3 License File ⚡ CRITICAL
**Tasks**:
- [ ] Add LICENSE file (currently missing)
- [ ] Decide on license (MIT? Apache 2.0?)
- [ ] Ensure build.gradle.kts references license

**Estimated Effort**: 15 minutes

#### 1.4 Version Strategy ⚡ CRITICAL
**Decision**: Start with **0.1.0** (signals "usable but early, expect issues")

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Set version to 0.1.0 in build.gradle.kts
- [ ] Create CHANGELOG.md with initial entry
- [ ] Document versioning strategy (SemVer)

**Estimated Effort**: 30 minutes

### Priority 2: IMPORTANT - Should Complete Before Release

#### 2.1 JitPack Publishing Setup
**Goal**: Enable installation via JitPack (faster than Maven Central)

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Verify build.gradle.kts is JitPack compatible
- [ ] Test JitPack build after first tag
- [ ] Add JitPack badge to README

**Estimated Effort**: 1 hour (simpler than Maven Central)

**Note**: Maven Central can come later after community feedback.

#### 2.2 GitHub Actions CI
**Tasks**:
- [ ] Create workflow for unit tests on PR/push
- [ ] Add build verification
- [ ] Add linting checks
- [ ] Document integration test strategy (manual only - requires API token)

**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 hours

#### 2.3 Critical Code TODOs
**Focus on user-facing issues only**:

- [ ] `RequestValidator.kt:528` - Add SLF4J, replace println
- [ ] `NotionClient.kt:97` - Document HTTP client options
- [ ] `PageProperty.kt:348` - Investigate timezone normalization (keep or remove TODO)
- [ ] `Database.kt:51` - Research URL nullability (keep or remove TODO)

**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 hours total

### Priority 3: NICE TO HAVE - Can Defer to Post-Launch

These are explicitly **NOT** blocking release:

- Enhanced request validation (require checks)
- Property type completeness review (rollups, formulas, etc.)
- Enum additions (currencies, timezones, etc.)
- Convenience functions (plainText helpers, etc.)
- Test suite reorganization
- File naming consistency review
- Rich Text & Block DSL alignment review
- Error deserialization enhancements
- Dependencies updates (unless security issues)
- Test icon consistency

**Rationale**: These are quality improvements that can be informed by real-world usage.

## Implementation Plan - STREAMLINED

### Phase 1: Blocking Items (Target: 1 session)
**Duration**: 4-6 hours

1. ✅ Choose license → **15 min**
2. ✅ Add LICENSE file → **15 min**
3. ✅ Package naming refactor (it.saabel) → **1-2 hours**
4. ✅ Set version to 0.1.0, create CHANGELOG → **30 min**
5. ✅ README enhancement with AI transparency → **2-3 hours**

**Success Criteria**: Library has proper naming, license, and transparent README.

### Phase 2: Important Items (Target: 1 session)
**Duration**: 4-5 hours

1. ✅ JitPack setup and testing → **1 hour**
2. ✅ GitHub Actions CI → **1-2 hours**
3. ✅ Critical code TODOs → **2-3 hours**

**Success Criteria**: Library is installable, has CI, and critical TODOs resolved.

### Phase 3: Release!
1. ✅ Tag v0.1.0
2. ✅ Create GitHub release with notes
3. ✅ Test installation via JitPack
4. ✅ Announce (if desired)

**Total Time to Release**: ~2 sessions (8-11 hours focused work)

### Phase 4: Post-Launch (Driven by Community Feedback)
- Property type gaps
- Convenience functions
- Enhanced validation
- Maven Central publication (if traction)
- All Priority 3 items

## Critical Decisions

### ✅ Decision 1: Initial Version
**Answer**: 0.1.0 - Signals early but usable, allows flexibility for breaking changes if needed.

### ✅ Decision 2: Package Name
**Answer**: `it.saabel.kotlinnotionclient` - Standard convention, do it now.

### ✅ Decision 3: License
**Options**: MIT (permissive, simple) or Apache 2.0 (permissive, patent clause)
**Recommendation**: MIT for simplicity
**Status**: ⏳ Needs decision

### ✅ Decision 4: Publishing Strategy
**Answer**: JitPack first (easy), Maven Central later (if community interest)

### ✅ Decision 5: Date/Time Enhancement
**Answer**: Already implemented with kotlinx-datetime. No changes needed. Update docs if claiming otherwise.

## Notes

- **Efficiency is key**: Don't perfectionism block release
- **Transparency about AI**: Better to acknowledge limitations upfront
- **Community feedback**: Will guide post-launch priorities better than speculation
- **JitPack first**: Much faster than Maven Central setup
- **Date/time works**: Using kotlinx-datetime, no changes needed
