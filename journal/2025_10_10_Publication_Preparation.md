# 2025-10-10: Publication Preparation & Final Polish

**Date**: 2025-10-10
**Status**: üöß Planning

## Overview

The Kotlin Notion Client is feature-complete with comprehensive test coverage and documentation. This phase focuses on preparing the library for public release and addressing remaining polish items. **Priority: Work efficiently - publish soon.**

## Current State

**Strengths**:
- ‚úÖ All major APIs implemented (Pages, Blocks, Databases, Data Sources, Search, Users, Comments)
- ‚úÖ Complete pagination helpers with Flow support
- ‚úÖ 481+ unit tests passing
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive integration test coverage
- ‚úÖ Complete documentation (all APIs, features, testing guide)
- ‚úÖ Migrated to Notion API 2025-09-03
- ‚úÖ Type-safe DSLs for queries, rich text, and blocks
- ‚úÖ Date/time support using kotlinx-datetime (not latest version but functional)

**Known TODOs in Codebase**:
1. `RequestValidator.kt:528` - Replace println with proper logging
2. `NotionClient.kt:97` - Add documentation on HTTP client options
3. `PageProperty.kt:348` - Review temporary timezone normalization fix
4. `Database.kt:51` - Verify if URL should be nullable

## AI-Assisted Development Notice

**Important Context**: This project was developed heavily with Claude Code assistance. While substantial effort has been invested in verification through:
- Comprehensive unit testing (481+ tests)
- Real API integration tests
- Manual code review and oversight
- Testing against official Notion API samples

**Potential issues to be aware of**:
- Documentation may claim more than is actually implemented
- Syntax examples in docs might not match actual implementation
- Edge cases in API coverage may be missed
- Serialization/deserialization edge cases
- Type safety gaps in DSL builders
- Inconsistencies between similar APIs (e.g., different parameter names/patterns)
- Comments or documentation referring to non-existent functionality

**The README must acknowledge these risks transparently** and encourage users to report issues.

## Goals

### Primary Goal: Publish Efficiently
- Enable other developers to discover, install, and use the library
- Be transparent about AI assistance and potential gaps
- Provide clear channels for feedback

### Secondary Goal: Critical Polish Only
- Address only blocking issues
- Defer nice-to-haves to post-launch

## Task Categories & Prioritization

### Priority 1: BLOCKING - Must Complete Before Release

#### 1.0 Git Repository Cleanup ‚ö°‚ö° CRITICAL - DO FIRST
**Rationale**: Once published, git history is permanent. Must review and clean before pushing to public.

**Tasks**:
- [ ] **Review commit history** for sensitive information
  - API tokens or credentials
  - Personal information
  - Internal URLs or server names
  - Private comments or TODOs not meant for public
- [ ] **Review file contents** for sensitive data
  - Check all config files (.env examples, etc.)
  - Review journal entries for private information
  - Check test files for real API credentials
  - Scan for any private reference materials
- [ ] **Review `.gitignore`** to ensure sensitive files are excluded
  - Environment files (.env, .env.local)
  - IDE-specific files
  - Build artifacts
  - Local test data
- [ ] **Check reference implementations** in `/reference/`
  - Verify licenses allow redistribution
  - Consider if these should be kept in public repo
  - May want to move to private reference or link to original sources
- [ ] **Review branch history**
  - Check if any branches contain sensitive experiments
  - Clean up or delete unnecessary branches
- [ ] **Consider squashing/rebasing** if history contains:
  - Messy "WIP" commits with potential issues
  - Commits that expose development mistakes better kept private
  - Multiple commits that should be atomic

**‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING**: This must be done BEFORE the first public tag. Git history rewriting after publication causes issues for users.

**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 hours (careful review required)

**Recommended Approach**:
1. Create a checklist of all files and directories
2. Use `git log --all --full-history` to review all commits
3. Use `git grep` to search for common patterns (token, password, secret, api_key, etc.)
4. If sensitive data found, consider `git filter-branch` or BFG Repo-Cleaner
5. Create a fresh branch from cleaned history for publication

#### 1.1 Package Naming Convention ‚ö° CRITICAL
**Current**: `no.saabelit.kotlinnotionclient`
**Target**: `it.saabel.kotlinnotionclient`

**Rationale**: Standard convention is reverse domain. Must be done before publication (breaking change).

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Refactor all package declarations
- [ ] Update imports across codebase
- [ ] Update build.gradle.kts with new group ID
- [ ] Update documentation references
- [ ] Verify tests still pass

**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 hours (mostly automated refactoring + verification)

#### 1.2 README Enhancement ‚ö° CRITICAL

**Must Include**:
- [ ] **AI Development Transparency Section**
  - Acknowledge Claude Code assistance
  - List potential pitfalls (see "AI-Assisted Development Notice" above)
  - Encourage bug reports and contributions
  - Link to issue tracker
- [ ] **Installation instructions** (Gradle/Maven with JitPack initially)
- [ ] **Quick start example** (complete, runnable code)
- [ ] **Feature highlights** (key selling points)
- [ ] **Link to comprehensive docs**
- [ ] **License information**
- [ ] **Contributing guidelines** (emphasize verification of AI-generated code)

**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 hours

#### 1.3 License File ‚ö° CRITICAL
**Tasks**:
- [ ] Add LICENSE file (currently missing)
- [ ] Decide on license (MIT? Apache 2.0?)
- [ ] Ensure build.gradle.kts references license

**Estimated Effort**: 15 minutes

#### 1.4 Version Strategy ‚ö° CRITICAL
**Decision**: Start with **0.1.0** (signals "usable but early, expect issues")

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Set version to 0.1.0 in build.gradle.kts
- [ ] Create CHANGELOG.md with initial entry
- [ ] Document versioning strategy (SemVer)

**Estimated Effort**: 30 minutes

### Priority 2: IMPORTANT - Should Complete Before Release

#### 2.1 Maven Central Publishing Setup
**Goal**: Publish to Maven Central (standard for professional libraries)

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Add Maven Publish plugin
- [ ] Configure POM metadata (name, description, URL, licenses, developers, SCM)
- [ ] Set up GPG signing for artifacts
- [ ] Configure Sonatype OSSRH credentials
- [ ] Add publication tasks to build.gradle.kts
- [ ] Test local publishing first
- [ ] Create Sonatype JIRA account and project ticket
- [ ] Publish and release through Sonatype

**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 hours (more involved than JitPack, but worth it)

**Reference**: Check reference Kotlin implementations for Maven Central setup patterns.

#### 2.2 GitHub Actions CI
**Tasks**:
- [ ] Create workflow for unit tests on PR/push
- [ ] Add build verification
- [ ] Add linting checks
- [ ] Document integration test strategy (manual only - requires API token)

**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 hours

#### 2.3 Critical Code TODOs
**Focus on user-facing issues only**:

- [ ] `RequestValidator.kt:528` - Add SLF4J, replace println
- [ ] `NotionClient.kt:97` - Document HTTP client options
- [ ] `PageProperty.kt:348` - Investigate timezone normalization (keep or remove TODO)
- [ ] `Database.kt:51` - Research URL nullability (keep or remove TODO)

**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 hours total

### Priority 3: NICE TO HAVE - Can Defer to Post-Launch

These are explicitly **NOT** blocking release:

- Enhanced request validation (require checks)
- Property type completeness review (rollups, formulas, etc.)
- Enum additions (currencies, timezones, etc.)
- Convenience functions (plainText helpers, etc.)
- Test suite reorganization
- File naming consistency review
- Rich Text & Block DSL alignment review
- Error deserialization enhancements
- Dependencies updates (unless security issues)
- Test icon consistency

**Rationale**: These are quality improvements that can be informed by real-world usage.
