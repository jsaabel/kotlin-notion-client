‚è∫ Based on my analysis of the three reference implementations, here's a comprehensive comparison:

  klibnotion (by BoD/JRAF)

  Features:

  - Kotlin Multiplatform (JVM, macOS, iOS, etc.)
  - Three API flavors: Coroutines, blocking, and Future-based
  - Comprehensive API coverage: OAuth, users, databases, pages, blocks, search
  - Rich DSL for content creation with builder pattern
  - Full CRUD operations on pages and blocks
  - Pagination support with ResultPage<T> wrapper
  - Extensive documentation and samples

  Strengths:

  - Most mature and feature-complete implementation
  - Strong type safety with sealed classes and proper error handling
  - Excellent architecture with clean separation of concerns
  - Production-ready with proper error handling, logging, and proxy support
  - Developer-friendly with comprehensive DSL and multiple API flavors
  - Well-documented with extensive API docs and samples

  Weaknesses:

  - Complex architecture might be overkill for simple use cases
  - Large codebase with many abstraction layers
  - Development not very active (author no longer uses Notion API)
  - Limited JavaScript/Web support

  notion-sdk-kotlin (by petersamokhin)

  Features:

  - Kotlin Multiplatform (JVM, JS, Native)
  - Database-focused with query capabilities
  - Markdown export functionality
  - Minimal API surface (4 main endpoints)
  - Specialized for data retrieval from Notion

  Strengths:

  - Lightweight and focused on specific use cases
  - Excellent for data extraction and migration scenarios
  - Markdown export is unique and valuable
  - Simple, clean API easy to understand
  - Good multiplatform support including JS and Native

  Weaknesses:

  - Limited functionality - only read operations
  - No write operations (create, update, delete)
  - No OAuth support
  - Minimal error handling
  - Basic documentation
  - Appears abandoned (last update 2+ years ago)

  Python Implementation (Reference)

  Features:

  - Page-centric object model
  - Property manipulation helpers
  - Database queries and filtering
  - File handling for covers and attachments
  - Custom utilities for common operations

  Strengths:

  - Simple, intuitive API with page-focused design
  - Practical utility functions for common tasks
  - Direct property access patterns
  - Good for rapid prototyping

  Weaknesses:

  - Python-specific patterns don't translate well to Kotlin
  - Limited type safety compared to Kotlin possibilities
  - Monolithic design with large classes
  - Basic error handling
  - No async support (blocking requests)

  Architecture Comparison

  | Aspect         | klibnotion                 | notion-sdk-kotlin   | Python          |
  |----------------|----------------------------|---------------------|-----------------|
  | API Design     | Facade + delegates         | Simple functions    | Object-oriented |
  | Type Safety    | Excellent (sealed classes) | Good (data classes) | Limited         |
  | Error Handling | Comprehensive              | Basic               | Basic           |
  | Async Support  | Full (coroutines)          | Partial             | None            |
  | Extensibility  | High                       | Medium              | Low             |
  | Learning Curve | Steep                      | Gentle              | Gentle          |

  Recommendations for Your Project

  Use klibnotion patterns for:
  - Overall architecture (facade + API delegates)
  - Type safety approach with sealed classes
  - Error handling patterns
  - DSL design for complex object creation
  - Multiplatform support structure

  Use notion-sdk-kotlin patterns for:
  - Simplified API surface for specific use cases
  - Markdown export functionality
  - Clean data model design

  Use Python patterns for:
  - Page-centric object modeling inspiration
  - Utility function patterns for common operations

  Hybrid approach: Start with klibnotion's architecture but with notion-sdk-kotlin's simplicity, gradually adding klibnotion's advanced features as needed.
