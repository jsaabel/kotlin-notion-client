# Uploading small files

Learn how to send and attach files up to 20 MB using the Notion API.

The Direct Upload method lets you securely upload private files to Notion-managed storage via the API. Once uploaded,
these files can be reused and attached to pages, blocks, or database properties.

This guide walks you through the upload lifecycle:

- Create a file upload object
- Send the file content to Notion
- Attach the file to content in your workspace

üí° **Tip:** Upload once, attach many times. You can reuse the same `file_upload` ID across multiple blocks or pages.

## Step 1: Create a File Upload object

Before uploading any content, start by creating a [File Upload object](/reference/file-upload). This returns a unique
`id` and `upload_url` used to send the file.

üß† **Tip:** Save the `id` ‚Äî You'll need it to upload the file in Step 2 and attach it in Step 3.

### Example requests

This snippet sends a `POST` request to create the upload object.

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url 'https://api.notion.com/v1/file_uploads' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer ntn_****' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Notion-Version: 2022-06-28' \
  --data '{}'
```

```python
import json
import requests

payload = {
    "filename": file_name,
    "content_type": "image/png"
}

file_create_response = requests.post("https://api.notion.com/v1/file_uploads", json=payload, headers={
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {NOTION_KEY}",
    "accept": "application/json",
    "content-type": "application/json",
    "Notion-Version": "2022-06-28"
})

if file_create_response.status_code != 200:
    raise Exception(
        f"File creation failed with status code {file_create_response.status_code}: {file_create_response.text}"
    )

file_upload_id = json.loads(file_create_response.text)['id']
```

### Example Response

```json
{
  "object": "file_upload",
  "id": "a3f9d3e2-1abc-42de-b904-badc0ffee000",
  "created_time": "2025-04-09T22:26:00.000Z",
  "last_edited_time": "2025-04-09T22:26:00.000Z",
  "expiry_time": "2025-04-09T23:26:00.000Z",
  "upload_url": "https://api.notion.com/v1/file_uploads/a3f9d3e2-1abc-42de-b904-badc0ffee000/send",
  "archived": false,
  "status": "pending",
  "filename": null,
  "content_type": null,
  "content_length": null,
  "request_id": "b7c1fd7e-2c84-4f55-877e-d3ad7db2ac4b"
}
```

## Step 2: Upload file contents

Next, use the `upload_url` or File Upload object `id` from Step 1 to send the binary file contents to Notion.

**Tips:**

- The only required field is the file contents under the `file` key.
- Unlike other Notion APIs, the Send File Upload endpoint expects a Content-Type of multipart/form-data, not
  application/json.
- Include a boundary in the `Content-Type` header [for the Send File Upload API] as described
  in [RFC 2388](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2388)
  and [RFC 1341](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc1341/7_2_Multipart.html). Most HTTP clients (e.g. `fetch`, `ky`) handle
  this automatically if you include `FormData` with your file and don't pass an explicit `Content-Type` header.

### Example requests

This uploads the file directly from your local system.

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url 'https://api.notion.com/v1/file_uploads/a3f9d3e2-1abc-42de-b904-badc0ffee000/send' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer ntn_****' \
  -H 'Notion-Version: 2022-06-28' \
  -H 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' \
  -F "file=@path/to-file.gif"
```

```javascript
// Open a read stream for the file
const fileStream = fs.createReadStream(filePath)

// Create form data with the (named) file contents under the `file` key.
const form = new FormData()
form.append('file', fileStream, {
    filename: path.basename(filePath)
})

// HTTP POST to the Send File Upload API.
const response = await fetch(
    `https://api.notion.com/v1/file_uploads/${fileUploadId}/send`,
    {
        method: 'POST',
        body: form,
        headers: {
            'Authorization': `Bearer ${notionToken}`,
            'Notion-Version': notionVersion,
        }
    }
)

// Rescue validation errors. Possible HTTP 400 cases include:
// - content length greater than the 20MB limit
// - FileUpload not in the `pending` status (e.g. `expired`)
// - invalid or unsupported file content type
if (!response.ok) {
    const errorBody = await response.text()
    console.log('Error response body:', errorBody)
    throw new Error(`HTTP error with status: ${response.status}`)
}

const data = await response.json()
// ...
```

```python
file_name = "test.png"
with open(file_name, "rb") as f:
    # Provide the MIME content type of the file as the 3rd argument.
    files = {
        "file": (file_name, f, "image/png")
    }
    response = requests.post(
        f"https://api.notion.com/v1/file_uploads/{file_upload_id}/send",
        headers={
            "Authorization": f"Bearer {NOTION_KEY}",
            "Notion-Version": "2022-06-28"
        },
        files=files
    )

if response.status_code != 200:
    raise Exception(
        f"File upload failed with status code {response.status_code}: {response.text}")
```

### Example response

```json
{
  "object": "file_upload",
  "id": "a3f9d3e2-1abc-42de-b904-badc0ffee000",
  "created_time": "2025-04-09T22:26:00.000Z",
  "last_edited_time": "2025-04-09T22:27:00.000Z",
  "expiry_time": "2025-04-09T23:26:00.000Z",
  "archived": false,
  "status": "uploaded",
  "filename": "Really funny.gif",
  "content_type": "image/gif",
  "content_length": "4435",
  "request_id": "91a4ee8c-61f6-4c27-bd41-09aa35299929"
}
```

‚è≥ **Reminder:** Files must be attached within 1 hour of upload or they'll be automatically moved to an `archived`
status.

## Step 3: Attach the file to a page or block

Once the file's `status` is `uploaded`, it can be attached to any location that supports file objects using the File
Upload object `id`.

This step uses standard Notion API endpoints; there's no special upload-specific API for attaching. Just pass a file
object with a type of `file_upload` and include the `id` that you received earlier in Step 1.

You can use the file upload `id` with the following APIs:

**[Create a page](/reference/post-page)**

- Attach files to a database property with the `files` type
- Include uploaded files in `children` blocks (e.g., file/image blocks inside a new page)

**[Update page properties](/reference/patch-page)**

- Update existing `files` properties on a database page
- Set page `icon` or `cover`

**[Append block children](/reference/patch-block-children)**

- Add a new block to a page ‚Äî like a file, image, audio, video, or PDF block that uses an uploaded file

**[Update a block](/reference/update-a-block)**

- Change the file attached to an existing file block (e.g., convert an image with an external URL to one that uses a
  file uploaded via the API)

### Example: add an image block to a page

This example uses the [Append block children](/reference/patch-block-children) API to create a new image block in a page
and attach the uploaded file.

```bash
curl --request PATCH \
  --url "https://api.notion.com/v1/blocks/$PAGE_OR_BLOCK_ID/children" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ntn_*****" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Notion-Version: 2022-06-28' \
  --data '{
    "children": [
      {
        "type": "image",
        "image": {
          "caption": [],
          "type": "file_upload",
          "file_upload": {
            "id": "'"$FILE_UPLOAD_ID'""
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }'
```

```python
# Append image to desired block (this could be a page,
# or a block within a page)
url = f"https://api.notion.com/v1/blocks/{append_block_id}/children"
payload = {
    "children": [
        {
            "object": "block",
            "type": "image",
            "image": {
                "type": "file_upload",
                "file_upload": {
                    "id": file_upload_id
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}

response = requests.patch(url, headers={
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {NOTION_KEY}",
    "accept": "application/json",
    "content-type": "application/json",
    "Notion-Version": "2022-06-28"
}, data=json.dumps(payload))

if response.status_code != 200:
    raise Exception(
        f"Block append failed with status code {response.status_code}: {response.text}")
```

### Example: add a file block to a page

This example uses the [Append block children](/reference/patch-block-children) API to create a new file block in a page
and attach the uploaded file.

```bash
curl --request PATCH \
  --url "https://api.notion.com/v1/blocks/$PAGE_OR_BLOCK_ID/children" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ntn_*****" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Notion-Version: 2022-06-28' \
  --data '{
    "children": [
      {
        "type": "file",
        "file": {
          "type": "file_upload",
          "file_upload": {
            "id": "'"$FILE_UPLOAD_ID"'"
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }'
```

### Example: attach a file property to a page in a database

This example uses the [Update page properties](/reference/patch-page) API to add the uploaded file to a `files` property
on a page that lives in a Notion database.

```bash
curl --request PATCH \
  --url "https://api.notion.com/v1/pages/$PAGE_ID" \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer ntn_****' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Notion-Version: 2022-06-28' \
  --data '{
    "properties": {
      "Attachments": {
        "type": "files",
        "files": [
          {
            "type": "file_upload",
            "file_upload": { "id": "9a8b7c6d-1e2f-4a3b-9e0f-a1b2c3d4e5f6" },
            "name": "logo.png"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }'
```

### Example: Set a page cover

This example uses the [Update page properties](/reference/patch-page) API to add the uploaded file as a page cover.

```bash
curl --request PATCH \
  --url "https://api.notion.com/v1/pages/$PAGE_ID" \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer ntn_****' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Notion-Version: 2022-06-28' \
  --data '{
    "cover": {
      "type": "file_upload",
      "file_upload": {
        "id": "'"$FILE_UPLOAD_ID"'"
      }
    }
  }'
```

‚úÖ **You've successfully uploaded and attached a file using Notion's Direct Upload method.**

## File lifecycle and reuse

When a file is first uploaded, it has an `expiry_time`, one hour from the time of creation, during which it must be
attached.

Once attached to any page, block, or database in your workspace:

- The `expiry_time` is removed.
- The file becomes a permanent part of your workspace.
- The `status` remains `uploaded`.

Even if the original content is deleted, the `file_upload` ID remains valid and can be reused to attach the file again.

Currently, there is no way to delete or revoke a file upload after it has been created.

## Downloading an uploaded file

Attaching a file upload gives you access to a temporary download URL via the Notion API.

These URLs expire after 1 hour.

To refresh access, re-fetch the page, block, or database where the file is attached.

üìå **Tip:** A file becomes persistent and reusable after the first successful attachment ‚Äî no need to re-upload.

## Tips and troubleshooting

- **URL expiration:** Notion-hosted files expire after 1 hour. Always re-fetch file objects to refresh links.
- **Attachment deadline:** Files must be attached within 1 hour of upload, or they'll expire.
- **Size limit:** This guide only supports files up to 20 MB. Larger files require
  a [multi-part upload](/docs/sending-larger-files).
- **Block type compatibility:** Files can be attached to image, file, video, audio, or pdf blocks ‚Äî and to `files`
  properties on pages.
